# Lao_Hans_Cyclic
- A Program That Determines If A Graph Has A Cycle Using BFS and DFS (Khan's Algorithm) Methods.
- Predefined Matrix was taken from given matrix during lecture.
- Output for DFS Method is Displayed as A->C->E->A To Better Reflect Cycle in a User Friendly Manner
- Output for BFS Method only outputs if a Cycle was Detected or Not
